<h2>Seattle Monday Night Pinball</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The Seattle Monday Night Pinball (MNP) is a friendly competitive pinball bar league in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area that
  aims to build interest in the hobby and encourage players and their teams to grow together. The league consists
  of 34 teams spread out over 20 venues, where each venue hosts one, two or three teams. Each team fields 10
  players weekly, thus there are 340 players competing weekly across 17 matches. A pool of over 150 Subs allows
  every team to field a full 10 players, even when one or more of their regular roster members are absent during
  a league night. Membership is only $1 per player per season; Substitutes can participate at no cost. Players are
  responsible for paying for their own pinball games on league night.

<h3>Fall 2025 Season</h3>
<p>
The schedule is now posted on this website here: <A HREF="schedule">SCHEDULE</A>. Playoffs will follow for the four Mondays following regular season's week 10.
</p>
<p>
   All teams from prior season have returned, although due to Coindexters venue closing, Pinballycule have moved to The Ice Box, and Contras have changed their name to Trolls and moved to 4Bs.
</p>
<p>League start time is 8:15pm, although players are encouraged to arrive by 8pm to confirm their attendance that night with their captains, and to get in some practice games. 
  At that time the visiting team is making their picks for Round 1. At 8:20pm, the home team should be responding, so that by 8:30pm all picks are made and players are ready to flip away
  in their first round games. League night is typically done by no later than 11:30pm, but could go a bit longer if there are technical difficulties or exceptionally long games.
