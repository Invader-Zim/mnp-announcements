<h2>Seattle Monday Night Pinball</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The Seattle Monday Night Pinball (MNP) is a friendly competitive pinball bar league in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area that
  aims to build interest in the hobby and encourage players and their teams to grow together. The league consists
  of 34 teams spread out over 20 venues, where each venue hosts one, two or three teams. Each team fields 10
  players weekly, thus there are 340 players competing weekly across 17 matches. A pool of over 150 Subs allows
  every team to field a full 10 players, even when one or more of their regular roster members are absent during
  a league night. Membership is only $1 per player per season; Substitutes can participate at no cost. Players are
  responsible for paying for their own pinball games on league night.

<h3>Spring 2024 Season</h3>
<p>
The season has begun! The schedule is now posted on this website here: <A HREF="schedule">SCHEDULE</A>. Playoffs will follow for the four Mondays following regular season.
</p>
<p>The <A HREF="ratings">IPR</A> Update occurred as planned on January 30, 2024.</p> However, due to new interfaces to the new Matchplay software, some of our automated IPR software 
broke. We've fixed some of it, enough to produce the IPR for every roster player and sub, but there are still some problems that we are working on. As a result, the Player Lookup 
works fine for players who have played in at least one MNP match in the past
six seasons. However, players new to the league may encounter errors and an IPR not reported. For those players, explicitly look up the player's IFPA and Matchplay ratings, then compare
their rating to the ranges at the bottom of the <A HREF="http://pinballstats.info/search/">Player Lookup</A> page. If you are having difficulty finding information or computing an IPR, 
contact Dave Stewart or Michael Adcock, or send email to <A HREF="mailto:SeattleMNP@gmail.com">MNP Board of Directors.</A>
</p>
We hope to have the issues with the player lookup resolved soon.
