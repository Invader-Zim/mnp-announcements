<h2>Seattle Monday Night Pinball</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The Seattle Monday Night Pinball (MNP) is a friendly competitive pinball bar league in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area that
  aims to build interest in the hobby and encourage players and their teams to grow together. The league consists
  of 34 teams spread out over 20 venues, where each venue hosts one, two or three teams. Each team fields 10
  players weekly, thus there are 340 players competing weekly across 10 matches. A pool of over 150 Subs allows
  every team to field a full 10 players, even when one or more of their regular roster members are absent during
  a league night. Membership is only $1 per player per season; Substitutes can participate at no cost. Players are
  responsible for paying for their own pinball games on league night.
