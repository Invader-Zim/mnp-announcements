<h2>Seattle Monday Night Pinball</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The Seattle Monday Night Pinball (MNP) is a friendly competitive pinball bar league in the Greater Seattle Metropolitan Area that
  aims to build interest in the hobby and encourage players and their teams to grow together. The league consists
  of 36 teams spread out over 20 venues, where each venue hosts one, two or three teams. Each team fields 10
  players weekly, thus there are 360 players competing weekly across 18 matches. A pool of over 180 Subs allows
  every team to field a full 10 players, even when one or more of their regular roster members are absent during
  a league night. Anyone can become a sub! Membership is only $1 per player per season; Substitutes can participate at no cost. Players are
  responsible for paying for their own pinball games on league night.

<h3>Spring 2026 Season</h3>

<p>
  MNP welcomes two new teams and one new venue to the league! Surf Champs joins the league with the new venue Gary's Place in West Seattle, right on Alki Beach. Ballard Locks is a second team at
  Ballard Smoke Shop. All teams from last season have also returned. This increases the total number of teams to 36, and now producing four equal-sized groups in the standings, with 9 teams in each. 
  As compared to last season, the groups have been redistributed, with a goal of balancing geographic location and team strength across the groups.

  <strong>New this season</strong>, if you are signed in, you can go directly to your team&apos;s current match using the <a href="/mymatch">"MY MATCH"</a> menu option.
  In addition, when choosing machines or players, you will see how much time has elapsed since the choosing phase began.
</p>
<p>League start time is 8:15pm, although players are encouraged to arrive by 8pm to confirm their attendance that night with their captains, and to get in some practice games. 
  At that time the visiting team is making their picks for Round 1. At 8:20pm, the home team should be responding, so that by 8:30pm all picks are made and players are ready to flip away
  in their first round games. League night is typically done by no later than 11:30pm, but could go a bit longer if there are technical difficulties or exceptionally long games.
